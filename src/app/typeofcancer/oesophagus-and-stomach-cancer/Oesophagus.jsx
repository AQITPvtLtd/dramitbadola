                                Serious gastrointestinal cancers that impact the upper portion of the digestive system are esophageal and stomach cancers, sometimes referred to as gastric cancer. Even though early diagnosis can be difficult, many patients now have better prognoses thanks to advancements in treatment and a better understanding of risk factors.

                                Early detection is challenging because both cancers frequently exhibit nebulous initial symptoms. Multidisciplinary management and prompt recognition, however, can greatly enhance results.

                                <li><strong>Surgery</strong> is the foundation for treatment that may be curative in cases that are early or locally advanced. Although they are major procedures, esophectomy (removal of part or all of the esophagus) and gastrectomy (removal of part or all of the stomach) can save lives.</li>
                                <li><strong>Chemotherapy</strong> is frequently used as an adjuvant or neoadjuvant before or after surgery to shrink tumors and stop them from coming back.</li>
                                <li><strong>Chemoradiation </strong> (a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy) may be applied to esophageal cancers, particularly in cases where surgery is not feasible right away.</li>
                                <li><strong>Targeted therapy</strong> (such as HER2-directed drugs) and <strong> immunotherapy </strong> (such as checkpoint inhibitors like pembrolizumab) are new choices based on tumor molecular testing for cases that are advanced or metastatic.</li>
